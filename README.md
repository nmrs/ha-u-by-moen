# U by Moen Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration for U by Moen smart shower systems (Alexa/Android version, not HomeKit).

## Features

- **Climate Control**: Control your shower temperature and power through Home Assistant's climate entity
- **Preset Activation**: Buttons to activate your configured shower presets (e.g., "Jason", "Lauren", "Fill The Tub")
- **Outlet Control**: Individual switches for each water outlet (shower head, hand shower, tub spout, body spray)
- **Status Monitoring**: Sensors for current temperature, target temperature, active preset, timer, and more
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Pusher WebSocket for instant status updates (coming soon)

## Installation

## Usage Examples

### Automations

Turn on shower at target temperature:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Shower Ready"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "06:30:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.master_bathroom
        data:
          temperature: 102
          hvac_mode: heat
```

Activate a preset:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Activate Jason's Shower"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.jason_home
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: button.press
        target:
          entity_id: button.master_bathroom_jason
```

Turn off shower after 15 minutes:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Shower Timeout"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: climate.master_bathroom
        to: "heat"
        for:
          minutes: 15
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.master_bathroom
        data:
          hvac_mode: "off"
```

### Lovelace Card Example

```yaml
type: thermostat
entity: climate.master_bathroom
```

Or a more detailed card:
```yaml
type: entities
title: Master Bathroom Shower
entities:
  - entity: climate.master_bathroom
  - entity: sensor.master_bathroom_current_temperature
  - entity: sensor.master_bathroom_active_preset
  - type: divider
  - entity: button.master_bathroom_jason
  - entity: button.master_bathroom_lauren
  - entity: button.master_bathroom_fill_the_tub
  - type: divider
  - entity: switch.master_bathroom_shower_head
  - entity: switch.master_bathroom_hand_shower
  - entity: switch.master_bathroom_tub_spout
```

## Known Limitations

- **Pusher WebSocket Events**: The control commands (turning on/off, changing temperature, activating presets) use Pusher client events. The exact event names are currently based on common patterns and may need to be refined through testing. If controls don't work immediately, we'll need to capture the actual WebSocket messages from the mobile app.

- **Real-time Updates**: Status updates currently rely on polling (every 30 seconds). Full Pusher WebSocket integration for instant updates is planned.

## Troubleshooting

### Integration not appearing
- Make sure you've restarted Home Assistant after installation
- Check the Home Assistant logs for any errors

### Authentication fails
- Verify your email and password are correct
- Make sure you're using the credentials for the Alexa/Android version of U by Moen (not HomeKit)

### Controls not working
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- The Pusher event names may need adjustment (see Known Limitations)
- Open an issue with debug logs

### Enable debug logging
Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.u_by_moen: debug
```

## API Information

This integration uses the Moen IoT API:
- **Base URL**: `https://www.moen-iot.com`
- **Authentication**: Token-based (obtained via email/password)
- **Real-time**: Pusher WebSocket (app_key: `dcc28ccb5296f18f8eae`, cluster: `us2`)

### Development Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make your changes
4. Test with your Home Assistant instance

### Capturing WebSocket Events

If you want to help improve the Pusher control commands:

1. Use Charles Proxy or similar tool
2. Enable SSL proxying for `*.pusher.com`
3. Monitor traffic while using the Moen mobile app
4. Capture the `client-*` events sent when controlling the shower
5. Share findings in an issue
